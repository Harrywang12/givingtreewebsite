4. Copy and paste the contents of `database-migration-password-reset.sql`
5. Click **"Run"** to execute the migration

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Make sure you have these environment variables set in your Vercel deployment:

```env
GMAIL_USER="your-admin-email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-gmail-app-password"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"
```

### Step 3: Test the Functionality
