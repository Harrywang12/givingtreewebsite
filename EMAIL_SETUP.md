GMAIL_USER=Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password_here
```

#### **For Local Development:**
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
GMAIL_USER=Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password_here
```

### 3. Add to Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Environment Variables" in the sidebar
4. Add two new variables:
   - **Name**: `GMAIL_USER`, **Value**: `Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com`
   - **Name**: `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, **Value**: `your_16_character_app_password`
5. Make sure both are set for "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
