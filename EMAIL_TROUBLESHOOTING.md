# 📧 Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## ⚠️ "Sent Successfully" but Not Receiving Emails?

If your email tests show "success" but you're not receiving emails, this is usually a **delivery/filtering issue**, not a sending problem.

## 🔍 **Step 1: Check These Locations First**

### 1. **Spam/Junk Folder** (Most Common!)
- Check your Gmail spam folder
- Look for emails from your website
- If found, mark as "Not Spam"

### 2. **Gmail Tabs**
- Check the **Promotions** tab
- Check the **Updates** tab
- Check **All Mail** folder

### 3. **Search Gmail**
- Search for: `from:yourdomain.com`
- Search for: `subject:"Contact Form"`
- Search for: `subject:"Donation Request"`

## ⚙️ **Step 2: Gmail Settings Check**

### Check Gmail Filters
1. Go to Gmail Settings (gear icon)
2. Click "Filters and Blocked Addresses"
3. Look for any filters that might be blocking emails
4. Delete any problematic filters

### Check Blocked Addresses
1. In the same "Filters and Blocked Addresses" section
2. Make sure your domain isn't blocked
3. Remove any blocks if found

### Check External Email Settings
1. Go to Gmail Settings → General
2. Look for any restrictions on external emails
3. Make sure external emails are allowed

## 🧪 **Step 3: Test with Different Email**

Try sending test emails to:
- Your personal Gmail account
- A Yahoo or Outlook account
- Another team member's email

This helps identify if the issue is specific to `Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com`

## 📋 **Step 4: Common Gmail Issues**

### Issue: Email Address Typo
- **Solution**: Double-check `Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com` is spelled correctly
- **Check**: Environment variables in Vercel

### Issue: Gmail Security Settings
- **Solution**: Make sure 2FA is enabled
- **Check**: App password is correct (16 characters)

### Issue: Domain Reputation
- **Solution**: New domains/servers may be filtered
- **Check**: Send emails gradually to build reputation

### Issue: Email Content Filtering
- **Solution**: Gmail might filter automated emails
- **Check**: Try simpler email templates

## 🔧 **Step 5: Technical Verification**

### Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Look for email-related function logs
4. Check for any error messages

### Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, check these are set:
GMAIL_USER=Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_password
```

### Test with Email Test Page
1. Go to `/test-email` on your website
2. Run "Email Configuration Test"
3. Check the message ID in the response
4. Look for detailed error messages

## 📞 **Step 6: Alternative Solutions**

### Use Multiple Email Services
- Set up a backup email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Use multiple Gmail accounts for redundancy

### Email Forwarding
- Set up email forwarding to multiple addresses
- Use a distribution list

### Manual Testing
- Send a manual email from your personal Gmail to `Givingtreenonprofit@gmail.com`
- Check if manual emails are received

## 🎯 **Most Likely Solutions**

**90% of delivery issues are solved by:**

1. **Checking spam folder** ✅
2. **Waiting 5-10 minutes** ⏰
3. **Verifying the email address** ✉️
4. **Checking Gmail tabs/filters** 🔍

## 📱 **Quick Test Commands**

Run these tests in order:

1. **Basic Test**: Use the email test page
2. **Personal Email Test**: Send to your personal email
3. **Manual Test**: Send a manual email to verify the account works
4. **Filter Test**: Check Gmail settings for filters

## 🆘 **Still Not Working?**

If emails are still not being received after following all steps:

1. **Contact Gmail Support** - There might be an account-specific issue
2. **Use Alternative Email Service** - Consider SendGrid or similar
3. **Check Domain Reputation** - Your domain might need time to build reputation
4. **Verify Account Settings** - Make sure the Gmail account is properly configured

## 📧 **Expected Behavior**

**Working correctly:** Test shows success + email appears in inbox within 1-5 minutes

**Common issue:** Test shows success + email goes to spam folder

**Rare issue:** Test shows success + email disappears (usually Gmail security filtering)
